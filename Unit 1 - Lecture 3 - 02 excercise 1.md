# Students in a line

Second graders are lining up to go to their next class, but must be ordered alphabetically before they can leave. The teacher only swaps the positions of two students that are next to each other in line.

If we want to represent this situation as a graph, which variables should be represented as edges and vertices?

 - A) Vertices represent permutations of the students in line. Edges connect two permutations if one can be made into the other by swapping two adjacent students.correct
 - B) Vertices represent students. Edges connect two students if they are next to each other in line.
 - C) Vertices represent permutations of the students, and each edge represents an individual student. An edge connects two vertices if that student is involved in swap between the two permutations.

Answer: A

 ## Explaination
 - A) is correct. Travelling from one vertex to another through an edge represents a legal move.
 - B) only offers information relevant to the current state of the line. There is no information regarding how the line can change.
